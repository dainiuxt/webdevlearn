[16 front-end projects (with designs) to help improve your coding skills](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl)

I wouldn't even know where to begin if someone asked me to create something beautiful from scratch! But, if a designer hands me a design I'll more than happily code it up.
If you're in the same boat, we've got some great projects for you at Frontend Mentor. Each one includes mobile & desktop designs, a front-end style guide (for fonts, colors, etc) and a basic brief. The assets are all provided and pre-optimized meaning all you need to focus on is writing the code!
